TODO:
- Measure graph statistics of the full permuted edgelists (not the ABCDE folded ones)
- Determine which models to use
    - Top performers from first study would be good starting point
    - Using all available would create (probably) too many LibKGE jobs
- Create config files
    - Do not split jobs by loss/training this time, those can be searched parameters in 1 job per model/dataset.
    - Do this by hand and ensure all available params are included
    - Figure out how to ensure identical hyperparam configs for trials of ABCDE folds of the same graph. 
        It might be the case that you can't, but thats ok because it means we have 5x the observations for the sens model.
    - Discuss above point with sups.
- Copy all datasets to LibKGE and start the analysis
    - Will need to figure out CUDA issue on bluepebble

DONE:
- Create permutations of raw graphs by iteratively removing X% of edgelists
- For each permuted graph, create 5 folds of 80/10/10
