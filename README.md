# Knowledge Graph Embedding Hyperparameter Sensitivity

This project aims to build on the findings of previous work [link to preprint here when uploaded] that showed that the response of embedding quality to changes in hyperparameter values is highly variable by dataset. We will use a similar methodology as the previous study, but this time we will include dataset statistics in our sensitivity model by iteratively permuting each of the three KGs to create a range of graph characteristics. Grid-search configurations will also be altered and more carefully designed than they were previously. By performing this more thorough experiment, we hope to identify areas of consistency across KGEs' hyperparameter sensitivities, as well as interactions between them and the measured graph statistics.
